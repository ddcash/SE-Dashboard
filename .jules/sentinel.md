## 2024-05-24 - Fix XSS via unescaped quotes, insecure URL protocols, and JS-context injection
**Vulnerability:**
1. Unescaped single quotes (`'`) allowed breaking out of HTML attributes.
2. Insecure URI schemes (`javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `data:`) could be executed.
3. User-provided URLs were interpolated directly into inline `onclick` handlers, causing JavaScript execution upon decoding (`');alert(1);//`).
**Learning:**
1. Single quotes must be properly escaped in our HTML encoding utility.
2. User-provided URLs must be sanitized to ensure safe protocols.
3. Interpolating user-supplied strings directly into inline JavaScript event handlers (like `onclick`) is unsafe, even if HTML-escaped, because the browser decodes HTML entities before evaluating the JavaScript.
**Prevention:**
1. Include single quotes in the `esc()` function.
2. Apply a URL sanitization function (`sanitizeUrl()`).
3. Store user-provided URLs in `data-` attributes and retrieve them dynamically within the event handler (`this.getAttribute('data-url')`), preventing JS execution.

## 2024-05-24 - Fix XSS via string interpolation in inline event handlers
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled inputs were directly interpolated into inline `onclick` event handlers (e.g., `onclick="someFunction('${userInput}')"`). This allowed attackers to break out of the string context and execute arbitrary JS, even if the input was HTML-escaped, because browsers decode HTML entities in attributes before executing JS.
**Learning:** Interpolating user-supplied strings directly into inline JS event handlers is unsafe regardless of standard HTML escaping.
**Prevention:** Store user-provided strings in `data-*` attributes and retrieve them dynamically within the event handler (`this.dataset.propertyName` or `this.getAttribute('data-property-name')`) rather than interpolating them directly into the inline script.
## 2025-02-27 - Fix XSS in inline event handlers
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled bookmark IDs (e.g., from imported JSON) and category IDs were directly interpolated into inline `onclick` event handlers (`onclick="trackClick(event,'${bm.id}','${catId}')"`). An attacker could bypass HTML-escaping because the browser decodes HTML entities before evaluating the JavaScript context.
**Learning:** Interpolating user-supplied strings directly into inline JavaScript event handlers is unsafe, even if HTML-escaped (`esc()`), because the browser decodes HTML entities before evaluating the JavaScript.
**Prevention:** Store user-provided dynamic identifiers (like IDs or URLs) in `data-` attributes on the DOM element and retrieve them dynamically within the event handler (e.g., `this.closest('.card').dataset.id`), preventing injection via entity decoding.
## 2024-05-24 - Entity-Encoded Scheme Bypasses in URL Sanitization
**Vulnerability:** URL sanitization for `javascript:` schemes failed to catch entity-encoded payloads like `java&#115;cript:alert(1)`. This occurred because `sanitizeUrl()` checked the raw string for malicious schemes, but when the sanitized URL was rendered via `innerHTML` into an `<a href="...">` attribute, the browser decoded the entities and formed a valid `javascript:` scheme.
**Learning:** Checking for malicious schemes without first fully decoding the string to its effective browser representation is insufficient, because standard HTML entity decoding will convert obfuscated payloads back into executable schemes upon rendering.
**Prevention:** Perform lightweight decoding of numeric entities (e.g. `&#x6A;` or `&#106;`) and handle null byte decoding (`\uFFFD`) in the sanitization logic before running the scheme-checking regex to catch entity-encoded bypass attempts.
